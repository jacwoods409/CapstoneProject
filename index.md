***WELCOME TO MY CAPSTONE PORTFOLIO PAGE!***


##
Three Artifacts make up my finished Capstone Project
###

- **Task Service Application**

- **The Emoji Application**

- **The Contact Application**


##  **Task Service Application**:
###
This application was based off of a basic java application where basic CRUD operations were performed on Java objects. However, to showcase my abilities,
I took this simple application and turned it into an efficient desktop GUI application. I built my own data structures for this application and plan to add
a SQL database to it as well in the future. I also implemented two different sorting algorithms which allow for the user to sort a large number of tasks
without having to worry about the program's speed. 

## **The Emoji Application**
### 
This application is a simple android application where the on-screen emoji changes everytime the phone is shaked. To enhance this application,
I added a testing mechanism for each class as well as added a feature that allows for the user to upload their own emojis into the application! 
This application also implements an SQL database to house the emojis.

## **The Contact Application**
### 
This application is a simple android application where user can add and maintain their contacts. To enhance this application,
I added a SQL database as well as added features that allows for the user to call and text message their contacts right from
the app!
